# Resistance & Liberation Map Helpers for Garry's Mod

A simple faux gamemode script that adds the Resistance & Liberation maps into their own map category.

Includes map icons for every map included with The Devil's Own R&L map packs, as well as several other uploads.

Also includes a script that adds the maps dynamically to resource.AddWorkshop based on when they're needed. Maps will be downloaded to the client as-needed as long as the client has this file. With this file you do not need to put the RnL maps into your collection. The server will send the required file to the client when it is needed.

This script is open source, as long as you also make any deviations open source.
